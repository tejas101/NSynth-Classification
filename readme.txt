1)Model1 and Model2 folders contains the respective models and all the needed code for visualization and waveforms images. Please run the models with the command python3 model1.py or python3 model2.py on the CS servers.
2) To plot the high and low probabilities wavefroms, test dataset's .wav files must be present in the respective
model folder and should be in this structure :"/nsynth-test/audio/abc.wav" 
3)The Graphs.py file contains code regarding the development of the graphs
for the distrubution fo audio samples of each instrument family
for test, validation, and trainings set. 
4)The Audio1D.py file contains code to develop a sample time vs amplitude graph of each
instrument family.
5).h5 file for model1 is ziped. Please unzip it before use.
